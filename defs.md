# Definitions

## Inductive inference / reasoning
"The process of reaching a general conclusion from specific examples." [1]

Examples are generalized into a model that is then used to make predictions on new, previously unseen inputs.

Examples can be all positive, or a mixture of positive and negative. Negative examples constrain the set of models that are consistent with the examples [1].

## Inductive Learning Hypothesis
"Any hypothesis found to approximate the target function well over a sufficiently large set of training examples will also approximate the target function well over other unobserved examples." [1]

## Inductive bias
"Explicit or implicit assumption(s) about what kind of model is wanted." [1]

## Concept Learning

### Classical view (philosophy)
"a process of abstraction, data compression, simplification, and summarization" [2]

### Rule-based
- Most have been powered by heuristics, not statistics [2].

### Prototype
Assumptions [2]:
- "people abstract out the central tendency (or prototype) of the examples experienced and use this as a basis for their categorization decisions." 
- "people categorize based on one or more central examples of a given category followed by a penumbra of decreasingly typical examples."
	- "people do not categorize based on a list of things that all correspond to a definition, but rather on a hierarchical inventory based on semantic similarity to the central example(s)."
