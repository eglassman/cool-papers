# Objects of learning 

We can learn knowledge:

1. Declarative
	- Categories
	- Concepts
	- Labels
2. Procedural
	- Functions, e.g., Python function definitions
	- Sequences of steps, e.g., tutorials

## Description
We can describe these objects in terms of surface and structural features.

Learning in the presence of variation in these features helps learners generalize and transfer their knowledge to new situations [1,2].

# Learning from examples

The way we frame the examples we use to teach declarative or procedural knowledge effects how students understand, generalize, and transfer their learning to new contexts.
