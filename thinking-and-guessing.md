### Abstract

Searching natural environments, as for example,
when foraging or looking for a landmark in a
city, combine reasoning under uncertainty, planning
and visual search. Existing paradigms for studying
search in humans focus on its isolated aspects,
such as step-by-step information sampling or visual
search, without examining advance planning.
We propose and evaluate a Bayesian model of how
people search in a naturalistic maze-solving task.
The model encodes environment exploration as a
sequential process of acquiring information modelled
by a Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP), which maximises the information
gained. We show that the search policy averaged
across participants is optimal. Individual solutions,
however, are highly variable and can be
explained by two heuristics: thinking and guessing.
Self-report and inference using a Gaussian
Mixture Model over inverse POMDP consistently
assign most subjects to one style or the another.
By analysing individual participantsâ€™ decision times
during the task we show that individuals often solve
partial POMDPs and plan their search a limited
number of steps in advance.
