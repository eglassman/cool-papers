### Abstract

We introduce Bayesian Eigenobjects (BEOs), a novel
object representation that is the first technique able to perform
joint classification, pose estimation, and 3D geometric completion
on previously unencountered and partially observed query objects.
BEOs employ Variational Bayesian Principal Component
Analysis (VBPCA) directly on 3D object representations to create
generative and compact probabilistic models for classes of 3D objects.
Using only depth information, we significantly outperform
the current state-of-the-art method for joint classification and
3D completion in both accuracy and query time. Additionally,
we show that BEOs are well suited for the extremely challenging
task of joint classification, completion, and pose estimation on a
large dataset of household objects.
